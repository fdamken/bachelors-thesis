\chapter*{Acknowledgments}



First of all I would like to thank my supervisor Joe Watson who not only introduced the whole Koopman theory to me and had the idea for this topic, but who always provided strong and invaluable feedback. I would also like to thank him for impressively quick responses to any question I had.

Furthermore I would like to thank Jan Peters, who first aroused my interest in robotics and machine learning.

I want to thank my fellow student Claas for always being there when I had any question and providing feedback from the beginning. I also want to express my appreciation for many helpful discussions in the past.

I want to thank Claas, Heiko, Stefanie and Tim for proofreading this thesis and providing feedback to the last minute. I also want to thank my parents for their support especially throughout my studies and the time of writing this thesis.
