\IMRADlabel{results}



In this chapter we will present all environments we experimented with as well as \emph{hyper-experiments}, \ac{ie} experiments with the hyperparameters and their influence on the algorithm performance (in terms of the prediction error and similar metrics, not the computing time).

We split this chapter into two parts: Firstly, we will present the experiment setup we used and the different environments we tested on. Secondly, we present our results and put them in context of other results. All critical discussion and comparison with related work will take place in~\autoref{c:discussion}.

\section{Setup}
	In this section we will introduce the experiment setup and all the different environments we used for evaluation.

	\subsection{Environments}
		This section covers the different environments we used and changed we might have applied to them. Do generate the data, you have to run the file \texttt{src/data.py} with the desired experiment ID as the first argument, \ac{eg} \texttt{python src/data.py pendulum\_damped}. If no argument is given, a regeneration of the data from all experiments is triggered. For each of the following environments we summarize the most important data about the environment at the start of the subsection, including the experiment ID.

		\subsubsection{Proof-of-Concept: Classic LGDS}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Experiment ID: \texttt{lgds}
			\end{itemize}

			As a proof-of-concept and to empirically verify our proof on the exactness of the cubature rule and hence the similar expected performance for plain linear systems, we benchmark our algorithm against a simple linear system. The linear system has a two-dimensional state \( \vec{y} \coloneqq \begin{bmatrix} x_1 & x_2 \end{bmatrix}^T \) with the dynamics
			\begin{align*}
				\dot{x}_1 &= x_2 \\
				\dot{x}_2 &= -x_1
			\end{align*}
			The initial state \( \vec{s}_1 \) is sampled from a Gaussian with mean \( \begin{bmatrix} 0.1 & 0.2 \end{bmatrix}^T \) and covariance \( \diag\big(10^{-5}, 10^{-5}\big) \). The system is integrated using the implicit Runge-Kutta Radau~IIA~\cite{guglielmiImplementingRadauIIA2001} method with an evaluation interval of \( h = 0.1 \) for \( T = 240 \) time steps where only the first \( T_\train = 120 \) steps are used for training and the remaining \(120\) are used for validation. The raw data is shown in~\autoref{fig:envLgds}.

			As the system's eigenvalues \( -i \), \( i \) are purely imaginary, the integrated system rings around the equilibrium \( \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}^T \) infinitely.

		\subsubsection{Proof-of-Concept: Polynomial}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Experiment ID: \texttt{polynomial}
			\end{itemize}

			This is our second proof-of-concept and the first that actually proofs our concept of learning nonlinear dynamics with a linear embedding. For this environments we

		\subsubsection{(Damped) Pendulum}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Experiment ID: \texttt{pendulum} and \texttt{pendulum\_damped}
			\end{itemize}

			The first nonlinear system we look at is the (inverted) pendulum in both an undamped and a damped setting. For this experiment, we use the angular state \( \vec{y} = \begin{bmatrix} \theta & \dot{\theta} \end{bmatrix} \) where \(\theta\) is the displacement angle (see~\autoref{fig:envPendulumSketch}). The dynamics are specified by the \ac{ode}
			\begin{equation*}
				\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta - d \dot{\theta}
			\end{equation*}
			that is solved using the Radau~IIA~\cite{guglielmiImplementingRadauIIA2001} \ac{ivp} integrator (after transforming the \ac{ode} in a first-order \ac{ode} system). The initial velocity is set to \(0\) and the initial position is sampled from a Gaussian with mean \( \pi/36 \) and variance \( \pi/8 \). This puts the pendulum in motion as it falls down from its initial position. For the undamped pendulum, we set \( d = 0 \). For both environments, we use an evaluation interval of \( h = 0.1 \) for \( T = 1000 \) time steps where only the first \( T_\train = 500 \) steps are used for training and the remaining \(500\) are used for validation. The raw data is shown in~\autoref{fig:envPendulum} for the undamped and~\autoref{fig:envPendulumDamped} for the damped pendulum.

			The damped pendulum is especially interesting as the system looses energy (\ac{ie} the sum of the kinetic and potential energy decreases over time) and Koopman theory in general has problems with finding embeddings that are able to encode energy loss\todo{citation needed}.

			\end{figure}
		% end

		\subsubsection{Gym Pendulum}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Experiment ID: \texttt{pendulum\_gym}
			\end{itemize}

			This is a sine/cosine version of the pendulum introduced before, but without damping. We use the environment of OpenAI Gym~\cite{brockmanOpenAIGym2016} for generating the data used for training. The motion equations are still the same as for the non-Gym pendulum
			\begin{equation*}
				\ddot{\theta} = \sin\theta
			\end{equation*}
			with \( d = 0 \) as the Gym pendulum does not include damping, but the state is defined as the sine and cosine of the angle:
			\begin{equation*}
				\vec{y} \coloneqq
					\begin{bmatrix}
						\cos\theta \\
						\sin\theta \\
						\dot{\theta}
					\end{bmatrix}
			\end{equation*}
			The Gym environment uses the Euler method for integrating the \ac{ode} with a step size of \( h = 0.05 \). We generate \( T = 100 \) time steps of which \( T_\train = 50 \) are used for training and the other \(50\) for validation. The raw data is shown in~\autoref{fig:envPendulumGym}.

		% end

		\subsubsection{Gym Cartpole}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Experiment ID: \texttt{cartpole\_gym}
			\end{itemize}

			The second last environment we run experiment on is the cartpole environment. In the cartpole environment, an inverted pendulum is build on a (typically controlled, but otherwise freely movable) cart. If the pendulum falls town, the torque on the joint is translated into a force moving the cart around. This creates nonlinear coupling and therefore highly nonlinear dynamics. A sketch of the cartpole environment is given in~\autoref{fig:envCartpoleGymSketch}. As for the previous pendulum, we rely on the cartpole implementation of Gym. We slightly modified the environment to be uncontrolled, as the environment usually has discrete actions for pushing the cart left or right. This modification is shown in~\autoref{lst:uncontrolledCartPole}. The state of the environment is given as
			\begin{equation*}
				\vec{y} \coloneqq
					\begin{bmatrix}
						x \\
						\dot{x} \\
						\theta \\
						\dot{\theta}
					\end{bmatrix}
			\end{equation*}
			where \(x\) is the cart position, \(\dot{x}\) is the cart velocity, \(\theta\) is the pole angle and \(\dot{\theta}\) is the angular velocity. The implemented equations of movement, taken from~\cite{florianCorrectEquationsDynamics2005}, are given as
			\begin{align*}
				\ddot{\theta} &= \frac{g \sin\theta + \cos\theta \Big(\! \frac{-F - m_p \ell \dot{\theta}^2 \sin\theta}{m_c + m_p} \!\Big)}{\ell \Big(\! \frac{4}{3} - \frac{m_p \cos^2\theta}{m_c + m_p} \!\Big)} \\
				\ddot{x} &= \frac{F + m_p \ell \big( \dot{\theta}^2 \sin\theta - \ddot{\theta} \cos\theta \big)}{m_c + m_p}
			\end{align*}
			where \( g = \SI{9.81}{\meter\per\second\squared} \) is the gravitational acceleration, \( m_p = \SI{0.1}{\kilogram} \) and \( m_c = \SI{1}{\kilogram} \) are the masses of the pole and cart, respectively, \( 2\ell = \SI{1}{\meter} \) is the pole length and \( [F] = \si{\newton} \) is the external (control) force acting on the cart that we set to \( \SI{0}{\newton} \). The Gym environment uses the Euler method for integrating the \ac{ode} with a step size of \( h = 0.02 \). We generate \( T = 300 \) time steps of which we use \( T_\train = 150 \) for training and the remaining \(150\) steps for validation. The raw data is shown in~\autoref{fig:envCartpoleGym}.

		\subsubsection{Gym Double Pendulum}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Experiment ID: \texttt{acrobot\_gym}
			\end{itemize}

			The last environment we test is the double pendulum, implemented in Gym as the \emph{acrobot} (as for the cartpole, we removed all control inputs and modified the initial state to start on top rather than hanging straight down, see~\autoref{lst:topAcrobot}). The double pendulum consists of a pendulum on a fixed joint and a second pendulum attached to the end of the first pendulum. This creates highly nonlinear coupling and is the most common example of a chaotic system~\cite{shinbrotChaosDoublePendulum1992}. We observe the state vector
			\begin{equation*}
				\vec{y} \coloneqq
					\begin{bmatrix}
						\cos\varphi_1 \\
						\sin\varphi_1 \\
						\cos\varphi_2 \\
						\sin\varphi_2 \\
						\dot{\varphi}_1 \\
						\dot{\varphi}_2
					\end{bmatrix}
			\end{equation*}
			where \(\varphi_1\) and \(\varphi_2\) are the displacement of the first and second joint, respectively. See~\autoref{fig:envDoublePendulumGymSketch}) for a sketch of the double pendulum. The governing equations of motion are given as:´
			\begin{align*}
				\ddot{\varphi}_1 &= \frac{g (\sin\varphi_2 \, \cos\varphi_\Delta - \mu \sin\varphi_1) - (\ell_2 \dot{\varphi}_2^2 + \ell_1 \dot{\varphi}_1^2 \cos\varphi_\Delta) \sin\varphi_\Delta}{\ell_1 (\mu - \cos^2\varphi_\Delta)} \\
				\ddot{\varphi}_2 &= \frac{g \mu (\sin\varphi_2 \, \cos\varphi_\Delta - \mu \sin\varphi_1) + (\mu \ell_1 \dot{\varphi}_1^2 + \ell_2 \dot{\varphi}_2^2 \cos\varphi_\Delta) \sin\varphi_\Delta}{\ell_2 (\mu - \cos^2\varphi_\Delta)}
			\end{align*}
			with \( \varphi_\Delta \coloneqq \varphi_1 - \varphi \), \( \mu \coloneqq 1 + m_1/m_2 \) where \( g = \SI{9.8}{\meter\per\second\squared} \) is the gravitational acceleration, \( m_1 = \SI{1}{\kilogram} \) and \( m_2 = \SI{1}{\kilogram} \) are the masses of the two links and \( \ell_1 = \SI{1}{\meter} \) and \( \ell_2 = \SI{1}{\meter} \) are the lengths of the two links. The Gym environment uses a \ac{rk4} for integrating the \ac{ode} with an evaluation interval of \( h = 0.2 \). We modified the initial position to be drawn from a Gaussian with mean \( \pi \) and standard deviation \( \pi/8 \) and the initial velocity to be drawn from a uniform distribution in the interval \( [-0.1, 0.1] \). We generate \( T = 100 \) time steps of which we use \( T_\train = 75 \) for training and the remaining \(25\) for validation. The raw data is shown in~\autoref{fig:envDoublePendulumGym}.

	\subsection{Experiment Setup}
		We will now introduce the experiment setup, initialization and similar stuff we used for each environment. For all experiments, we initialized the latent state dynamics matrix \( \mat{A} \) with an identity matrix, the initial state \( \vec{m}_0 \) with a one-vector and all covariance matrices \( \mat{R} \), \( \mat{R} \) and \( \mat{V}_0 \) with a small diagonal covariance of \( 10^{-5} \). We set the maximum number of \(\vec{g}\)-optimization iterations to \(1000\) for all environments. As described in~\autoref{sec:implementation}, we used a neural network for the observation function with \(\tanh\) activation functions (except for the output layer of course) and a single hidden layer with \(50\) neurons. The environment-specific parameters and the hidden layer sizes are given in~\autoref{tab:experimentSetup}.

		\todo{Update table once more results are here and we changed hyperparameters!}
		\begin{table}
			\centering
			\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
				\textbf{Environment} & \textbf{Whitening?} & \textbf{Latent Dim.} & \textbf{Max. Iterations} \\ \hline
				      Pendulum       &         no          &        \(10\)        &         \(100\)          \\
				  Damped Pendulum    &         yes         &        \(10\)        &         \(200\)          \\
				    Gym Pendulum     &         no          &        \(10\)        &         \(500\)          \\
				    Gym Cartpole     &         yes         &        \(8\)         &         \(500\)          \\
				    Gym Acrobot      &         no          &        \(16\)        &         \(350\)
			\end{tabular}
			\caption{Overview over the different hyperparameter setting for the different environments.}
			\label{tab:experimentSetup}.
		\end{table}

		For the proof-of-concept environments (the linear system and the polynomial system), we used slightly different setups as those environments are a lot simpler. For the linear system, we used a zero-layer neural network with no activation function, \ac{ie} a learnable matrix/linear transformation. We also fix the latent dimensionality to be \(2\) for the linear system as we only have two states. For the polynomial system, we know~\cite{williamsonLearningNonLinearDynamical2020} that the Koopman operator has the exact finite form
		\begin{equation*}
			\mat{K} =
				\begin{bmatrix}
					\mu & 0       & 0        \\
					0   & \lambda & -\lambda \\
					0   & 0       & 2\mu
				\end{bmatrix}
		\end{equation*}
		with the Koopman observations \( \big(x_1, x_2, x_1^2\big) \). However, as we seek the \emph{inverse} Koopman observations, we chose a single hidden layer neural network with \(10\) hidden neurons and \(\tanh\) activation function and \(10000\) maximum \(\vec{g}\)-optimization iterations.
	% end

	\subsection{Hyper-Experiments}
		Besides the performance on specific environments, we where interested in how hyperparameters like the latent dimensionality affect the performance of the system. In this section we will discuss and present our experiment setup for the "hyper-experiments". All hyperparameters that are not part of the experiment where set to the ones listed in~\autoref{tab:experimentSetup}.

		If not stated differently, we always ran the experiment with five different seeds\footnote{Namely, we used the seeds \(0\), \(11\), \(42\), \(1234\) and \(1997\) that where chosen on a random basis.} to average out initialization noise.

		\subsubsection{Influence of the Latent Dimensionality}
			\label{subsec:experimentLatentDim}

			As the latent dimensionality directly influences how well the Koopman matrix can approximate the infinite-dimensional operator, it is one of the most interesting hyperparameters we evaluated. Hence, we evaluated lots of different latent dimensionalities from \( k = 1 \) to \( k = 50 \) (for cartpole, we did \( k = 1, 2, \rangedots, 100 \)).
		% end
	% end

\section{Results}
	In this section we will look at the results of the experiments described above. We organized the section into the different environments and will take a look at both the hyper-experiments first and then the individual results for optimized\todo{Really? The optimized hyperparameters?} hyperparameters.
