\section{Relation of HMMs, LGDS and Koopman Dynamical Systems}
	% Show nice images, or reference them from ch. 2.
	% They make the underlying idea of the thesis quite obvious.

\section{Formulating and Solving the Nonlinear Approximate Inference Problem using an Approximate EM Algorithm}
	% Formulate likelihood, expected likelihood.
	% Shortly outline how to do the derivation and reference appendix.
	% Summarize M-step equations.
	% Combine ideas from ch. 2 (cubature and sqrt) and summarize.

\section{Implementation}
	% Discuss training tricks (max. iterations and stuff).
	% Find reasons why and explain difficulties with learning from multiple observation sequences at once.
	% Highlight more performant QR decomposition on the GPU.
